  <h1>Assignment Questions for Day 2</h1>

  

  <h2>Methods of String and Array.</h2>
  <p style="color:rgb(255, 123, 0);font-size:18px;"> String Methods are as follows <br><br>


1.Substring<br><br>
2.Substr <br><br>
3.Slice.
<br><br>
1. str.slice(start [, end])<br>
This method is use to slice any strings according to their index.

let str = "Aakash";<br>
console.log( str.slice(0, 3) ); // 'kash', the substring from 0 to 5 (not including 3)<br><br>

If we dont provide 2nd args, then slicing will from 1st index to last index of the string:<br>
console.log( str.slice(2) ); 

<br><br>
2. str.substring(start, [end])<br>
Returns the part of the string between start and end.
<br>
This is almost the same as slice, but it allows start to be greater than end.
<br>

<br><br>
3. str.substr(start [, length])<br>
Returns the part of the string from start, with the given length.
<br>
In contrast with the previous methods, this one allows us to specify the length instead of the ending position:
<br>
console.log( str.substr(2, 4) ); // 'ka', from the 2nd position get 4 characters <br>
// The first argument may be negative, to count from the end:<br>

<br>
Replacing String Content <br>
This method is use to replace a specified value with another value in a string:<br><br>


var str2 = 'Aakash is working hard';<br>
console.log(str2.replace("is", "was,"));
</p>
<br><br>

<p style="color:yellowgreen;font-size:18px;">

2. Array Methods:
<br>
How to delete an element from the array?
<br>
The arrays are objects, so we can delete string from an array:
<br><br>

  let arr = ["Aakash", "Learning", "JavaScript"];<br><br>


  delete arr[1];remove "Learning"<br><br>


  alert( arr[1] ); undefined
<br><br>

now arr = ["Aakash",  , "JavaScript"];<br><br>

  alert( arr.length ); // 3 <br>
  <br>

  The element was removed, but the array still has 3 elements, we can see that arr.length == 3.</mark>
<br><br>

But for arrays we usually want the rest of elements to shift and occupy the freed place. We expect to have a shorter array now.
<br><br>
So, special methods should be used.
<br><br>
The arr.splice(start) method is a swiss army knife for arrays. It can do everything: insert, remove and replace elements.
<br><br>
It starts from the position index: removes deleteCount elements and then inserts elem1, ..., elemN at their place.
Returns the array of removed elements.
<br><br>
This method is easy to grasp by examples.
Letâ€™s start with the deletion:
<br><br>
let arr = ["we", "love", "India"];
arr.splice(1, 1); // from index 1 remove 1 element
<br><br>
alert( arr ); // ["we", "India"]
<br><br>
let arr3 = ["lets", "go", "tracking", "some", "day"];
<br>
// remove 2 first elements <br>
let removed = arr.splice(0, 2);
<br>
alert( removed ); // "I", "study"  array of removed elements
</mark>
<br>
The call to arr.sort() sorts the array in place, changing its element order.
<br><br>

It also returns the sorted array, but the returned value is usually ignored, as arr itself is modified.
<br.<br> 
let arr4 = [ 92, 29, 119,220 ];

  // the method reorders the content of arr <br><br>
  arr.sort();

  alert( arr );  [119, 220, 29, 92]
<br>
Did you notice anything strange in the outcome?
The order became[119, 220, 29, 92]. Incorrect. But why?
The items are sorted as strings by default.
Literally, all elements are converted to strings for comparisons. For strings, lexicographic ordering is applied and indeed "2" > "15".
To use our own sorting order, we need to supply a function as the argument of arr.sort().
The function should compare two arbitrary values and return:
<br><br>

function compareNumeric(a, b) { <br><br>
  if (a > b) return 1;<br><br>
  if (a == b) return 0;<br><br>
  if (a < b) return -1; <br><br>
}<br>
<br><br>
let arr5 = [119, 220, 29, 92]<br>
console.log(arr5);<br>
arr5.sort(compareNumeric);this will commpard the value in acsending order give the output according to that
<br><br>
console.log(arr5);  // [29, 92, 119, 220]
